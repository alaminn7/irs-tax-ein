                        <p>Filing for an Employer Identification number (EIN) can be strenuous at times, that is where we come in, to alleviate that burden. No matter what entity type you are applying for: LLC, C-CORP, S-CORP, PARTNERSHIP, SOLE PROPRIETOR, TRUST, or if you are the executor, administrator, or personal representative of an ESTATE, we will work alongside the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on your behalf, as your third party designee. We will take on the responsibility of going over your application to ensure that the proper documentation is gathered, and sent to the IRS to obtain your EIN in an expedited manner.</p>

You will have access to our staff of compassionate and knowledgeable customer service representatives that will resolve any questions you may have about the process.

A large number of EIN applications require our representatives to be on the phone for over an hour per application but we are dedicated to providing quality service to our clients at any cost.</p>
                        <p>You will have the benefits of using our proprietary system to view the status of your application as well as to have access to information that will get you in contact with your representative via phone or email.

                        <p>5. How the Company Protects Your Personal Information</p>
                        <p>&gt;The Company takes precautions—including administrative, technical, and physical measures—to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required and to make online purchases you must use an SSL- enabled browser 3 in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

                        <p>While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining your personal information.</p>
                        <p>6. Integrity of Your Personal Information</p>
                        <p>The Company has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used.

                        <p>7. Privacy of Children</p>
                        <p>Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. The Company recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our services for family use, including use by minors, such as a birth certificate. We do not anticipate that any child will use our services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing or any other purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Company purchaser of the service, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to the Company and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. It is our policy to comply 3 This is required by GDPR and California law, as well as the new 2020 law. Check to make sure.</p>
                        <p>4 This is not a choice but mandatory that the consumer has access to their data and can make or order – through email or call center or other method to change any info they desire, close an account if they want, and transfer (port) their data to themselves (as in a .csv or other format). It should be as easy as password access to their data and account.</p>
                        <p>with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. Therefore, we restrict our web site to persons 18 years or older.</p>
